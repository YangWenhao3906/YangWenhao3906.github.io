Aloha! (*^▽^*) Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a senior student at [Faculty of Computing](https://computing.hit.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/).

In September 2023, I will be a PhD candidate in Computer Software and Theory at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Minghui Zhou](https://minghuizhou.github.io/) at [Open Source Software Data Analytics Lab](https://osslab-pku.github.io/), [Software Engineering Institute](http://www.sei.pku.edu.cn/).
